      It is unclear yet whether this document will be submitted to the W3C, either
      to the XQuery WG or as Community Group. For the time being it lives under the
      <a href="http://exquery.org/" title="EXQuery: Extensions for EXQuery">EXQuery project</a>.

      Whilst XQuery [[!XQUERY]] was originally envisaged and designed as a query language for XML,
      it has been adopted by many as a language for application development. This specification
      describes a set of XQuery 3.0 Annotations [[!XQUERY-30]] and a small set of functions to enable XQuery
      to provide RESTful services, thus enabling Web Application development in XQuery.
    </section>
    
    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        XQuery processors are now frequently provided as part of complete data application
        processing platforms, which typically incorporate amongst others, XML Data storage
        and Web serving capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        XQuery has long been recognised as a good language for producing XHTML and HTML from
        complex data queries, however XQuery is almost completely ignorant of the Web.
        XQuery provides no native capabilties for either making Web requests or operating
        as a server-side scripting language and processing Web requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of XQuery 3.0 there is still no standard way to create Web Applications in XQuery.
        Many vendors provide extensions to their XQuery implementations which allow users
        to serve web requests using XQuery processing.
        Whilst vendors have borrowed ideas from each other, there is no standard for Web capabilities
        in XQuery, as such developers have to use proprietary extensions, which limits the portability
        of their XQuery code, ultimately fragmenting the XQuery community, limiting re-use and reducing
        peer-learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        RESTXQ attempts to resolve these problem of interoperablility. RESTXQ defines a standard set of
        vendor agnostic XQuery Annotations and functions for XQuery 3.0. When implemented by vendors,
        these annotations provide a standard W3C XQuery 3.0 compliant approach to delivering RESTful
        Web Services from XQuery, whilst the functions provide user convenience for interacting with
        implementations of RESTXQ.
      </p>
      <section id="goals">
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>
          The guiding goals for the RESTXQ specification are:
          <dl>
            <dt>Interoperability</dt>
              <dd>
                Only features that are already present in XQuery 3.0 MUST be applied to create RESTXQ.
                Any XQuery code that makes use of RESTXQ instead of vendor extensions, is valid XQuery 3.0
                code, and therefore portable. Note, RESTXQ support is required in the XQuery processor to
                execute resource functions in a Web context.
              </dd>
            <dt>Simplicity for XQuery developers</dt>
              <dd>XQuery developers MUST NOT have to maintain external or complex code for wiring RESTful
                services to XQuery functions. Developers should just write standard XQuery.
              </dd>
            <dt>Vendor Agnostic</dt>
              <dd>RESTXQ MUST NOT assume anything about an implementation above what is defined in
                XQuery 3.0. RESTXQ MUST be equally implementable by any vendor.
              </dd>
            <dt>Technical improvement</dt>
            <dd>RESTXQ MUST improve on the current approaches, a comprehensive review was undertaken

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
          This specification is intended for both vendors and developers looking to implement RESTXQ in
          their products, XQuery developers looking to use the RESTXQ features defined in this specification,
          and individuals wishing to establish the correctness of implementations with respect to the requirements
          of this specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          This document assumes that readers already have at least a basic understanding of XQuery 3.0, and
          an understanding of Web technologies and server side scripting.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Namespaces and Prefixes</h3>
        <p>
          The annotations and functions discussed in this document are contained in one of
          two namespaces (see [[!XML-NAMES]]) and referenced using an xs:QName.
          The namespace prefix used in this document for annotations and functions that are
          solely related to RESTXQ is <code>rest</code>.
          <!-- TODO are these in this doc? -->Serialization annotations and functions are named with the prefix <code>output</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This document uses the prefix <code>rerr</code> to represent the namespace URI <code>http://exquery.org/ns/restxq/error</code>, which is the namespace for all RESTXQ error codes and messages. This namespace prefix is not predeclared and its use in this document is not normative.
        </p>
        <p>
          The namespace prefix used for the functions, datatypes and errors can vary, as long as the prefix is bound to the correct URI.
        </p>
        <p>
          The URIs of the namespaces and the default prefixes associated with them are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>http://exquery.org/ns/restxq</code> for annotations and functions -- associated with <code>rest</code>.</li>
          <li><code>http://www.w3.org/2010/xslt-xquery-serialization</code> for annotations and functions -- associated with <code>output</code>.</li>
          <li><code>http://exquery.org/ns/restxq/error</code> for annotations and functions -- associated with <code>rerr</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
          The namespace URI associated with the <code>rerr</code> prefix is not expected to change from one version of this document to another. The contents of this namespace may be extended to allow additional errors to be returned.

          <h4>XQuery 3.0 Annotations</h4>
          <p>
            Whilst XQuery 3.0 introduces many new features, an understanding of Annotations in XQuery 3.0
            is fundamental to this specification. Annotations declare properties of functions or variables,
            zero or more annotations may be added to a function or variable declaration. Annotations start
            with the '%' character and consist of an expanded qualified name and an optional value, the
            value being a sequence of literals.
          </p>
          <pre class="example" title="XQuery 3.0 Annotations">
        xquery version "3.0";
        
        declare namespace java = "http://java";
        
        declare
        %java:method("java.lang.Math.sin")
        function local:calculate-sin($a as xs:double) as xs:double external
        
        &lt;sin&gt;{
          local:calculate-sin(1.4)
        }&lt;/sin&gt;
          </pre>
          <p>
            Apart from the <code>%private</code> and <code>%public</code> annotations, no other annotations are defined by
            the XQuery 3.0 specification. However, the specification states,
            &quot;Implementations MAY define further annotations, whose behaviour is implementation-defined&quot;.
            It is this property which this specification exploits to define a standard set of RESTful Annotations for XQuery 3.0.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="approach">
          <h4>Approach</h4>
          <p>
            RESTXQ is heavily influenced by that of JAX-RS [[!JAX-RS]]. However, we simplify and deviate from JAX-RS
            predominantly due to the language structure differences between Java and XQuery. Where JAX-RS describes Resource Classes
            and Resources Methods for Java, in XQuery we simply use the term Resource Function; for mapping HTTP calls
            to XQuery invocation, our unit of granularity is the XQuery function.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through the use of annotations on functions in XQuery, we declaratively mark-up the HTTP capabilities
            of a function. To minimise refactoring by developers when adding annotations to existing code, two measures
            must be respected by implementations:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Implementations of RESTXQ MUST support annotated functions which have additional function parameters which are not annotation mapped, providing the cardinality type of those un-mapped parameters accepts an empty sequence.</li>
            <li>Implementors MUST not enforce the order of function parameters. Whether mapped by annotations or not is unimportant, as annotations explicitly name the parameters to which they are mapped.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section id="resource-functions">
        <h3>Resource Functions</h3>
        <p>
          A Resource Function is an XQuery function which has been marked up with RESTXQ annotations. These annotations
          indicate to a processor that when presented with a RESTful web service request, that matches the constraints
          indicated by the annotations, that the function SHOULD be invoked and the result SHOULD be returned as the result of
          the service request.
        </p>
        <p>There are two types of Resource Function Annotations described in RESTXQ:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Constraints (<a href="#resource-function-constraints" class="sectionRef"></a>)</li>
          <li>Parameters (<a href="#resource-function-parameters" class="sectionRef"></a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <section id="templates">
          <h4>Templates</h4>
          <p>
            Some of the RESTXQ Annotations make use of Templates, which allow for the substitution of parameters
            from the request into the query. The syntax of these templates is very simple and is designed to be
            familiar to existing XQuery developers, it is expressed in <a href="#template-grammar" class="sectionRef"></a>.
          </p>
          <p>The Template appears inside a string literal within the annotation, but the meaning is that the
            value of the templated substitution MUST be used as the parameter to the named argument of the
            annotated function.</p>
          <pre class="example" title="Template">
            {$number-of-cats}
          </pre>
          <p>
            In the example above, a parameter given from the template substitution MUST be
            set for the function argument called <code>number-of-cats</code> on the annotated function.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="resource-function-constraints">
          <h4>Resource Function Constraints</h4>
          <p>Constraints restrict the service requests that a Resource Function MAY process.</p>
          <section id="path-annotation">
            <h5>Path Annotation</h5>
            <p>
              A Path Annotation maps the URI of a RESTful web service to a Resource Function and provides for path templates.
            </p>
            <p> <!-- TODO also consider allowing zero or more path annotations -->
              A Resource Function MUST contain a single path annotation. Additional annotations MAY also be
              used to constrain or parameterize the Resource Function.
            </p>
            <p>
              The path annotation is named <code>%rest:path</code> and takes a single mandatory literal string, which
              describes the URI path for this service. The URI path is considered relative to a base URI (<a href="#base-uri" class="sectionRef"></a>) which is
              implementation defined.
            </p>
            <p>
              The URI path itself MAY contain zero or more URI templates which denote path segments that MUST
              map to named function parameters. Parameters addressed by templates in the URI path, MUST meet the
              following constraints:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <!-- TODO describe error codes -->
                Cardinality that MUST allow for an atomic value, otherwise an error should be raised by the
                implementation. i.e. ONE or ONE_OR_MORE.</li>
              <li>
                <!-- TODO describe error codes -->
                Type that MUST inherit from xs:anyAtomicType, otherwise, an error should be raised by the implementation.
                In addition, conversion from the URI segment string to the required type should be performed at run-time,
                and an error raised if conversion is impossible.
                <!-- TODO describe type conversion -->
              </li>
            </ol>
            <pre class="example" title="Path Annotation">
              declare
                %rest:path("/stock/widget/{$id}")
              function local:widget($id as xs:int) {

                fn:collection("/db/widgets")/widget[@id eq $id]
              };
            </pre>
            <p>
              In the above example, a HTTP GET on the following URI, would cause the Widget with the <code>id</code> of '1981'
              to be retrieved: <em>http://www.widget-factory.com/stock/widget/<code>{$id}</code></em>.

          Functions against HTTP requests.
        </p>
        <p>The specificity of a Resource Function is governed by three rules which MUST be applied in order:</p>

      <h2>Resources for Implementers</h2>
      <p>
        If you plan to implement RESTXQ, there is already a set of common abstraction libraries written in Java
        which should significantly reduce the ammount of effort involved and avoid re-inventing more wheels. You need
        just implement a few interfaces and adapters. For more information see the
        <a href="http://www.github.com/exquery/exquery" title="EXQuery GitHub">EXQuery GitHub page</a>.
